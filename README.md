# Bulls-and-Cows
<b> This program implements the 4-digit code-breaker game which goes by the name Bulls and Cows. </b>

<b> Guidelines </b>
1. Please make sure that you get familiarized with this game by going through the .pdf file present in this repository.<br>
2. Think of a 4-digit secret code using the digits from 0 through 9. The secret code should not start with 0 and should not have a repeated digit. <br>
3. Compile and run <a href="http://10.250.8.18/iitdhcd-new/pro0.php">this</a> program to start the game. <br>
4. The program will also have a 4-digit secret code which you will have to break! So, it will be a two-player game on terminal.<br>

<b> Good luck! <b>
