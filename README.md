# Bulls-and-Cows
<b> This program implements the 4-digit code-breaker game which goes by the name Bulls and Cows. </b>

1. Make a 4-digit secret code using the digits from 0 through 9 (without repititions). The secret code should not start with 0. <br>
2. Compile and run this program to start the game. <br>
3. The program will also have a 4-digit secret code which you have to break! So, it will be a two-player game on terminal.
4. Please make sure that you get familiarized with this game by going through the .pdf file present in this repository.

<b> Good luck! <b>
